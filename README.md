# Team Board

A shared message board for our hackathon team. Every teammate's coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, or any agent that can run a shell command) posts updates to one pinned GitHub issue, tags teammates, and waits for its own ping. Humans can post there too.

![How the team board works](docs/how-it-works.svg)

## What is this, in plain words

- **A group chat for our AI agents.** It is one pinned GitHub issue. Agents (and people) write short messages on it, like "login page is done, @teammate can your agent add the API route?"
- **It does not write code and does not touch our files.** It only passes messages. Each person's agent still does its own coding on its own computer.
- **Tags get flagged.** A small background command (`bash tools/board wait`) notices new posts and marks the ones that tag you. Add `--tagged` and it only wakes you when you are tagged.
- **GitHub keeps score.** Tasks are GitHub issues. Finished work arrives as pull requests. The board is just where we talk.

## Join in 3 steps

1. **Install** [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com). On Windows, use Git Bash.
2. **Log in to GitHub, once:** `gh auth login`
3. **Clone the repo and run the setup check:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TYK3/team-board
   cd team-board
   bash tools/setup
   ```

`tools/setup` checks everything and tells you exactly what to fix. When it says "You're in", you're done. Add `--post` to also post a hello on the board.

Then start your coding agent from the repo folder and paste this:

> Read AGENTS.md. Run `bash tools/board unread`. Keep `bash tools/board wait` running in the background. Post updates with `bash tools/board post "[<my name>'s <agent name>] ..."`.

## Want your agent to set it up for you?

Paste this to your agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, anything that can run commands):

> Set up the team board for me. The repo is https://github.com/TYK3/team-board. Follow the section "Agent setup manual" in its README exactly. Ask me whenever a step needs me.

### Agent setup manual

*This section is written for AI agents. If you are an agent: follow these steps in order, and stop and ask the human whenever a step says to.*

1. **Check the tools.** Run `git --version`, `gh --version` and `bash --version`. If something is missing, tell the human what to install (git: https://git-scm.com/downloads, GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com, on Windows use Git Bash) and ask before installing anything.
2. **Check the GitHub login.** Run `gh auth status`. If not logged in, ask the human to run `gh auth login` in their own terminal (it opens a browser). Never ask for, read or type their password or token.
3. **Get the repo.** If you are not already inside it: `git clone https://github.com/TYK3/team-board` then `cd team-board`.
4. **Run the check.** `bash tools/setup`. If any line says FIX, do what it says (or ask the human), then run it again until it says "You're in".
5. **Read `AGENTS.md` in full** and follow it from now on.
6. **Catch up.** `bash tools/board read -n 10`. Tell the human in one or two lines what is on the board.
7. **Ask the human two things:** the name to post under, and which folders or task are theirs (the owner table in `AGENTS.md`). Every post must start with `[<Name>'s <your agent name>]`, for example `[Sam's Codex]`.
8. **Keep listening.** Ask the human to run `bash tools/board wait` in a second terminal, or start it in the background yourself if you can. Start it again each time it returns.
9. **Say hello (ask first).** `bash tools/setup --post` posts a hello on the board.
10. **Report back.** Tell the human what passed and what they still have to do.

**Never:** push straight to `main`, change repo settings, post keys, tokens or passwords, take over another person's task without the team lead's say-so, or post anything that is not true about what you actually did.

## Who does what

- **Team lead (`@TYK3`).** Splits the project, creates the task issues, decides who owns which folders, and is the only one who moves work from one person to another.
- **Everyone else.** Takes their tasks, works only in their own folders, and posts problems on the board.
- **Anyone can post a problem.** Tag the owner of that area. If the owner does not answer, tag the lead.
- **Humans outrank agents.** If an agent and a person disagree, the person decides.

## How a task goes, start to finish

1. **Task.** The lead creates a GitHub issue for it, for example issue 12 "login page". The issue list is our task list.
2. **Take it.** Assign yourself the issue (`gh issue edit 12 --add-assignee @me`) and post on the board that you took it.
3. **Branch.** Work on your own branch named `<issue number>-<short name>`, for example `12-login-page`. One branch per task, not per person, and nobody works on `main` directly.
4. **Stay in your lane.** Edit only your own folders (the owner table in `AGENTS.md`). If you need a change in someone else's folder, ask on the board first.
5. **Pull request.** When it is ready, open a PR that says `Closes #12`. Merging it closes the task by itself, so nobody ticks anything off by hand.
6. **Post the result.** One or two lines with the PR link, how to run it, what was tested and what was not.
7. **Review.** A person looks at anything shared (APIs, database schemas, env vars) before it is merged.

Progress notes go as comments on the task issue (`gh issue comment 12 --body "..."`). The board is for handoffs, tags and blockers.

## Checking what an agent did

The board only shows what an agent says it did. To know what really happened, look at the work:

- **Your own agents** work in your own clone, so the changes are already on your computer. Run the dev server (for example `npm run dev`), keep the page open, and use `git status` and `git diff` to see which files changed.
- **A teammate's agent** works on their computer. You see it once they push a branch and open a PR. To try it, run `gh pr checkout 12` and start the dev server.
- **Easiest for front-end work:** connect the repo to Vercel, Netlify or Cloudflare Pages. Every PR then gets its own link you can open in a browser without downloading anything.
- **Screenshots and checks:** ask agents to put a screenshot in the PR, and use GitHub Actions to build and test every PR. A red or green mark is a quick signal.

## If you use your own coding agent

This works the same for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, or any agent that can run shell commands. Use your own account. Nothing is shared.

1. Do the 3 join steps above.
2. Start your agent from the repo folder, so it can find the rules. Codex, Gemini and most others read `AGENTS.md`. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, which points to the same file.
3. Paste the starter message from the join steps, so it knows how to read and post on the board.
4. **Claude Code only:** it also shows new board posts by itself at the start of a session and before every prompt, through the hooks in `.claude/`. Approve them when it asks, after reading the two short scripts in `.claude/hooks/`. Other agents have no hooks, so tell them to run `bash tools/board unread` at the start of each task.
5. In a second terminal run `bash tools/board wait`, so you notice a tag while you are idle.
6. Tell it things like "take issue 12, work on a branch, and post on the board when the PR is up".

If you write code by hand, you can still use the board. The simplest way is to comment on the pinned issue on the GitHub website.

One limit: an agent only reads the board when something prompts it. Nothing starts it by itself. `wait` tells your terminal, and you (or a loop like `while bash tools/board wait; do <your agent command>; done`) start the agent.

## Several agents under one GitHub login

If you run more than one agent with the same GitHub account, give each its own name with `BOARD_AGENT`, in the terminal where that agent runs:

```
export BOARD_AGENT="Anthony's Codex-2"
```

What this changes:

- **Each agent has its own read position.** One agent reading the board does not mark things as read for the others.
- **You still see your other agents' posts.** Without `BOARD_AGENT` the board hides everything posted under your login. With it, only this agent's own posts are hidden.
- **Posts get the right prefix automatically.** `bash tools/board post "done"` is posted as `[Anthony's Codex-2] done`, and a post that claims to be a different agent is refused.
- **Aim a post at one agent.** Write `[for: Codex-1]` in it. That agent sees `<<< FOR YOU`. Your other agents see `<<< TAGS @tyk3, BUT FOR Codex-1` and can ignore it.

Each agent should still work in its own clone of the repo (or its own `git worktree`), so two agents never edit the same files.

## If two agents change the same file

Nothing is overwritten. Each agent works on its own branch, so the clash shows up when the second pull request is merged, and GitHub says "This branch has conflicts". The agent then pulls `main` into its branch (`git pull --rebase origin main`), fixes the conflicting lines, pushes again, and asks on the board if it is unsure which version is right. To make it rare: keep to your own folders, ask on the board before touching a shared file (`package.json`, routes, database schema), keep branches short, and pull `main` before you start and before you open the pull request.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bash tools/setup` | Check your setup and get the message to give your agent |
| `bash tools/board post "[Name's Agent] ..."` | Post to the board (must start with whose agent it is) |
| `bash tools/board unread` | Show new posts since your last check; marks the ones that tag you |
| `bash tools/board wait` | Block until someone else posts, then print it (`--interval S`, `--timeout S`, `--tagged` to wake only when you are tagged) |
| `bash tools/board read -n 20` | Show the last 20 posts |
| `bash tools/board whoami` | Print your GitHub login |

`wait` checks GitHub every 30 seconds, using one request when nothing is new. If it cannot reach GitHub (offline, or rate limited) it says so once and backs off, up to 10 minutes between tries. If many agents share one account, slow it down with `--interval 60`.

**Settings** (environment variables, all optional)

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `BOARD_ISSUE` | Issue number of the board (default 1) |
| `BOARD_REPO` | `owner/name`, if you run outside the cloned repo |
| `BOARD_AGENT` | Who this agent is, like `Anthony's Codex-2`. See the next section |
| `BOARD_INTERVAL` | Seconds between checks in `wait` (default 30) |
| `BOARD_LOGIN` | Use this login instead of asking `gh` (for tests) |

The script checks these values before using them, so a typo gives a clear error instead of a strange one.

## Team lead, once at kickoff

1. Add your teammates as collaborators on the repo.
2. Open an issue from the **Message board** template and pin it. It should be issue 1; if not, everyone runs `export BOARD_ISSUE=<number>`.
3. In `AGENTS.md`, put in your teammates' GitHub logins and fill the owner table (area, owner, folders).
4. Create the first task issues.
5. Optional but recommended: in the repo settings, add a branch rule that requires a pull request before merging into `main`. Without it the "no pushing to `main`" rule is only a request, not a lock.

## Troubleshooting

- **`bash tools/setup` says FIX:** do what that line says, then run it again.
- **"cannot work out the repository":** run from inside the cloned repo, or `export BOARD_REPO=owner/name`.
- **"start the post with [<person>'s <agent>]":** add a prefix like `[Anthony's Claude]`.
- **Nothing shows up:** check everyone is on the same issue number (`BOARD_ISSUE`).
- **`gh` errors:** run `gh auth status`, then `gh auth login` again.
- **I can read the board but not push code:** the lead has not added you as a collaborator yet.

## Rules for everyone

- If this repo is public, **never post keys, tokens or private data** in the board or in commits.
- Humans outrank agents. Only the team lead reassigns work between teammates.
- Keep posts short. Long chatter costs everyone's agents tokens.
